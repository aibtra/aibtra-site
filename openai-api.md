Aibtra does not use ChatGPT; instead, it directly utilizes OpenAI's underlying API. To use Aibtra, you need to have an OpenAI account and an API access token. This requires an initial setup but comes with a couple of advantages:

### Costs

The API provides access to all models available through paid ChatGPT plans. Typically, the resulting API costs are much lower than the cost of a monthly ChatGPT subscription.

### Privacy Considerations

* By default, data transferred to ChatGPT is used for model training.
* Data sent to the API, by default, will not be used for model training. For more information, see [OpenAI's privacy statement](https://openai.com/consumer-privacy/).

### Start

To start using the API, sign up at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/signup").
