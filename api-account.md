Aibtra does not operate through an AI Assistant (such as ChatGPT); instead, it directly accesses the platform's AI Models using their respective APIs.
To use Aibtra, you need to have an account on one of the supported platforms and an API access token.
This requires an initial setup but comes with a couple of advantages:

### Costs

The API provides access to all models available, including those only accessible through paid plans (like ChatGPT Pro). Typically, the resulting API costs are significantly lower than a monthly subscription fee.

### Privacy Considerations

* By default, data transferred to an AI Assistant (like ChatGPT) is often used for model training.
* Data sent to the API is generally not used for model training by default. For more information, for example, refer to [OpenAI's privacy statement](https://openai.com/consumer-privacy/).
